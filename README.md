# Django(1.9) examples

<p>
	Bank of examples for Django(1.9) to make learning easier.
</p>
<p>
	One example should represent only one thing.
</p>
<p>
	To contribute contact to me via email or go directly to skype(two_dim_array)
	I'm just started out and not quite get how to do this properly,
	so if you have a better vision for the project let me know.
